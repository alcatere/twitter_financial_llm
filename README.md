## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies tweets into Positive, Neutral, or Negative categories.
- **Customizable Models**: Train or fine-tune on financial-specific data for better accuracy.
- **Interactive Predictions**: Includes a Streamlit app for real-time sentiment analysis.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Reports accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance tracking.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of financial tweets, preprocessed and labeled into three sentiment categories:
- **Bullish**: Indicates optimism. Investors believe prices will increase in the future.

## Model and Training
- **Model Architecture**: The model is based on a transformer architecture (e.g., `DistilBERT`).
- **Pretrained Checkpoint**: Fine-tuned using `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` as the base model.
- **Training Pipeline**:
  - Tokenization with Hugging Faceâ€™s `AutoTokenizer`.
  - Fine-tuning using `AutoModelForSequenceClassification`.
  - Optimized with techniques like learning rate scheduling and early stopping.
